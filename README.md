# Video-Chat-Application

This project is a video chat application that utilizes the WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) technology. It allows users to engage in real-time video calls directly in their web browsers without the need for any additional plugins or software installations.

The application is built using PHP on the server-side to handle signaling and JavaScript on the client-side to establish peer-to-peer connections and manage the video chat functionality.

## Features
- Real-time video chat: Users can have face-to-face video conversations with others in real-time.
- Peer-to-peer connections: The application establishes direct connections between users' web browsers, enabling efficient video streaming.
- Signaling server: PHP is used to handle the signaling process between users, allowing them to discover and establish connections.

## Prerequisites
To run the video chat application, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your development environment:

- PHP (version 7.0 or higher)
- Web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.)
- Web browser with WebRTC support (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)
